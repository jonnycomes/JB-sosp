# Jellyfish Brauer Calculations

Using python to generate data in search of a defining relation for Jellyfish (aka Enhanced) Brauer categories related to special orthosymplectic supergroups. 

## Navigating the repo

### Python

There are currently two python scripts for calculating the jellyfish action:
	* Comes' code: [sosp.py](src/sosp.py)
	* Ethan's code: [jellyfish.py](src/jellyfish.py)

### Data

The directory [data](data/) holds all data that has been generated. It currently has various .txt files corresponding to calculations of the jellyfish action generated by the script sosp.py.
